# Speed Optimizations Applied

## Overview
The scraper has been optimized for faster extraction while maintaining reliability. Here are the key improvements:

## 1. Configuration Changes (config.js)
- **Mode System**: Added 'fast' and 'stealth' modes
- **Reduced Delays**: 
  - Page load: 5000ms → 2000ms
  - Between requests: 3000ms → 1000ms
  - Scroll delay: 2000ms → 1000ms
  - Human delay: 1500ms → 500ms
  - New listing delay: 250ms (fast mode)

## 2. Base Scraper Optimizations (baseScraper.js)
- **Navigation**: Pre-navigation delay reduced from 1-3s to 0.5-1.5s
- **Human Behavior**: 
  - Mouse movements: 2-4 → 1-2
  - Scrolling: 1-2 scrolls → 1 scroll
  - Movement delays: 100-300ms → 50-150ms
  - Scroll delays: 500-1500ms → 200-500ms

## 3. Yellow Pages Scraper Optimizations (yellowpages.js)
- **Page Loading**: Initial wait reduced from 8s to 3s
- **Element Waiting**: Selector timeout reduced from 3s to 2s
- **Fallback Wait**: Additional wait reduced from 5s to 2s
- **Listing Processing**: 
  - Delay between listings: 0.5-2s → 0.2-0.5s
  - Implemented batch processing (5 listings per batch)
  - Parallel processing within batches
- **Protection Page Handling**:
  - Strategy 1 wait: 10s → 5s
  - Strategy 2 wait: 8s → 4s
  - Strategy 3 wait: 15s → 8s
  - Strategy 4 delays: 5s → 2s, 12s → 6s

## 4. Batch Processing Implementation
- **Parallel Processing**: Process 5 business listings simultaneously
- **Error Isolation**: Individual listing errors don't stop the batch
- **Progress Tracking**: Better progress reporting per batch
- **Memory Efficiency**: Process in smaller chunks to avoid memory issues

## 5. Performance Improvements
- **Faster Element Re-querying**: Avoid stale element handles
- **Reduced Timeouts**: All waiting periods optimized
- **Better Error Handling**: Continue processing even if individual listings fail
- **Configurable Speed**: Easy switch between fast and stealth modes

## Usage
The scraper now runs in 'fast' mode by default. To switch to 'stealth' mode for more human-like behavior:

1. Open `config.js`
2. Change `mode: 'fast'` to `mode: 'stealth'`

## Expected Speed Improvement
- **Fast Mode**: ~60-70% faster than original
- **Stealth Mode**: Similar to original speed but with better reliability

## Trade-offs
- **Fast Mode**: Higher speed, slightly higher detection risk
- **Stealth Mode**: Lower detection risk, moderate speed
- **Batch Processing**: Better throughput, slightly more complex error handling

## Monitoring
The scraper provides detailed progress reporting to monitor performance:
- Batch processing progress
- Individual listing processing status
- Error reporting without stopping execution
- Total processing time tracking
